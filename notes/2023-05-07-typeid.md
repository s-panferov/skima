At the current stage of the project we treat Markup as a "template" and do not store any information inside the Markup nodes. Instead we use `AnyData` storage insude a `Tree` to store the internal state.

This works great for cases like `Arc<impl Markup>` when you may want to use the same Markup template in sevaral places.

Unfortunately, today I found that this strategy does not work good enough for SSR + bump allocation, because everything we store inside `AnyData` should be `'static` and it's not possible with satisfy this requirement with bumps.

I've tried to use somethings like `better_any::Tid<'a>` type for AnyData, but this created so many new challenges that I decided to drop this effort.

Alternative solution might be to embrace data storage inside the `Markup` nodes itself, which would allows us storing non-'static data.

This also have it's own set of challenges:

* We'll probably have to disallow Rc<impl Markup> to be a `Markup` to prevent all markup copies working with the same "storage". I need to think more about this.

* We'll have to constantly transfer internal state from "prev" markup to "next" on diffs.
